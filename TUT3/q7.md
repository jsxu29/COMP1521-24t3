## Array Address


address of array[i] = address of array + offset 
= address of array + i * sizeof(each array element)

1) Find the number of bytes we need to offset inside the array.
Don't forget to consider the size of each array element.


i.e.
```
mul     $t1, <index>, 4 
```

2) Find the base address of the array

```
la     $t2, <array name> 
```

3) Add the offset to the base address

```
add     $t3, $t1, $t2
```

4) Store value at the calculated address

```
sw      <somewhere>, ($t3)
```
